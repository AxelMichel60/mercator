## Introduction

Mercator is a Web application for managing the mapping of an information system as described in the
[Mapping the Information System Guide](https://cyber.gouv.fr/guide/mapping-the-information-system)
from [ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/en).

### Objective

Mercator's objective is to enable a team to manage the mapping of an information system in a complete and consistent way, and to automatically generate the various reports needed to facilitate the maintenance and communication of this mapping.

Maintaining an up-to-date and complete cartography is a long and complex job. Mercator makes it possible to divide this work between several teams (infrastructure, network, system, application...) and automatically generate infrastructure diagrams, extract inventories and generate mapping reports.

Mercator has the advantage of being simple to use, install and implement within an organization.

### Limitations

The data model used in Mercator is based on that proposed by ANSSI. If the information system to be modeled is large, complex and comprises numerous heterogeneous systems, this model may prove incomplete.

However, by making a few concessions regarding the completeness of the mapping, it is often possible to model the information system using the model proposed here.
